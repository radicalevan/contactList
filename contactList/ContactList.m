//At this point we're taking user input, and creating a new model object using our results, but we still need to store them somewhere. To do this, create a new ContactList class, with an NSMutableArray property where it will store contacts. Make sure to instantiate a mutable array for that property in the ContactList's init method.
//
//Now back in main.m, create your ContactList instance outside your main-menu while loop, so that it isn't reset each loop.
//
//Once all this is set up, add a method to your ContactList class called -(void)addContact:(Contact *)newContact, and in this method insert the contact into the ContactList's mutable array.
//
//Call your ContactList's addContact: method with the Contact instance you created a moment ago.
